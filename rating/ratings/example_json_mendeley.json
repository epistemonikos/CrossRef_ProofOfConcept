    "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of a single session of partial-body cryotherapy (PBC) on muscle recovery, 26 young men performed a muscle-damaging protocol that consisted of five sets of 20 drop jumps with 2-min rest intervals between sets. After the exercise, the PBC group (n = 13) was exposed to 3 min of PBC at -110 °C, and the control group (n = 13) was exposed to 3 min at 21 °C. Anterior thigh muscle thickness, isometric peak torque, and muscle soreness of knee extensors were measured pre, post, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h following exercise. Peak torque did not return to baseline in control group (P < 0.05), whereas the PBC group recovered peak torques 96 h post exercise (P > 0.05). Peak torque was also higher after PBC at 72 and 96 h compared with control group (P < 0.05). Muscle thickness increased after 24 h in the control group (P < 0.05) and was significantly higher compared with the PBC group at 24 and 96 h (P < 0.05). Muscle soreness returned to baseline for the PBC group at 72 h compared with 96 h for controls. These results indicate that PBC after strenuous exercise may enhance recovery from muscle damage.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a single partial-body cryotherapy bout between training sessions on strength recovery. 12 young men (23.9±5.9 years) were randomly exposed to 2 different conditions separated by 7 days: 1) Partial-body cryotherapy (subjects were exposed to 3 min of partial-body cryotherapy at - 110 °C between 2 high-intensity training sessions); 2) Control (subjects were not exposed to partial-body cryotherapy between 2 high-intensity training sessions). Subjects were exposed to partial-body cryotherapy after the first training session. The 2 knee extension high-intensity training sessions were separated by a 40-min rest interval. Knee extension training consisted of 6 sets of 10 repetitions at 60°.s(-1) for concentric actions and 6 sets of 10 at 180.s(-1) for eccentric actions. The decrease in eccentric peak torque and total work was significantly (p<0.05) less after partial-body cryotherapy (5.6 and 2%, respectively) when compared to control (16 and 11.6%, respectively). However, the decrease in concentric peak torque and total work was not different (p>0.05) between partial-body cryotherapy (9.4 and 6.5%, respectively) and control (7.5 and 5.2%, respectively). These results indicate that the use of partial-body cryotherapy between-training sessions can enhance eccentric muscle performance recovery.",

We use direct (UPS) and inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IFS) to examine the occupied and unoccupied electronic structure of Ag(110)c(4 x 4)C-60 and IFS to examine the unoccupied electronic structure of Au(110)(6 x 5)C-60. Comparing the data with multilayer spectra we observe clear and unequivocable signatures of final and initial state effects in the spectra. The final state effects take the form of screening of the ionic final state. Charge transfer from Ag(110) into first layer C-60 molecules is directly observed by UPS and the interaction of first layer C-60 molecules with the substrate is further evidenced by a broadening of C-60 features, ascribed to a splitting of molecular orbitals. The work functions of Ag(110)c(4 x 4)C-60 and Au(110)(6 x 5)C-60 are found to be equal to that of bulk C-60. The combination of the work function measurements and the spectroscopy give new insights into the bonding of C-60 on these surfaces.",

    "abstract": "A subset of naturally formed sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1)-bearing CD8(+)CD44(+)CCR7(+) memory T cells has been identified in transplant recipient BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice. The frequency of this subset of memory T cells is significantly increased in the spleen, lymph nodes and skin grafts in the recipient BALB/c mice during acute skin allograft rejections. The immune-reconstitution with CD8(+)CD44(+)CCR7(+)S1P1(+) memory T cells facilitates acute skin allograft rejection in SCID mice. Being Th1-polarized and cytotoxic, CD8(+)CD44(+)CCR7(+)S1P1(+) memory T cells proliferate and differentiate immediately into effectors upon encountering allo-antigens. A siRNA against S1P1 inhibits CD8(+)CD44(+)CCR7(+)S1P1(+) memory T cell-mediated acute skin allograft rejection in SCID mice by means of knocking-down S1P1-expression. CCL21 mutant (CCL21-DeltaCT) has been used to compete with wild-type CCL21 in the course of binding to CCR7. Combined administration of siRNA S1P1 and CCL21-DeltaCT significantly prolongs the survival of skin allograft in the recipient BALB/c mice by means of inhibiting accumulation of CD8(+)CD44(+)CCR7(+)S1P1(+) memory T cells in the spleen and the skin grafts. Our data provide direct evidence that S1P1 and CCR7 are involved in the proliferation and trafficking of CD8(+)CD44(+)CCR7(+)S1P1(+) memory T cells. S1P1 may serve as a functional marker for CD8(+)CD44(+)CCR7(+) memory T cells. Targeting CD8(+)CD44(+)CCR7(+)S1P1(+) T cells may be a useful strategy to prolong the survival of allograft transplant.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this investigation was to elucidate the reductions in muscle, skin and core temperature following exposure to -110°C whole body cryotherapy (WBC), and compare these to 8°C cold water immersion (CWI). Twenty active male subjects were randomly assigned to a 4-min exposure of WBC or CWI. A minimum of 7 days later subjects were exposed to the other treatment. Muscle temperature in the right vastus lateralis (n=10); thigh skin (average, maximum and minimum) and rectal temperature (n=10) were recorded before and 60 min after treatment. The greatest reduction (P<0.05) in muscle (mean ± SD; 1 cm: WBC, 1.6 ± 1.2°C; CWI, 2.0 ± 1.0°C; 2 cm: WBC, 1.2 ± 0.7°C; CWI, 1.7 ± 0.9°C; 3 cm: WBC, 1.6 ± 0.6°C; CWI, 1.7 ± 0.5°C) and rectal temperature (WBC, 0.3 ± 0.2°C; CWI, 0.4 ± 0.2°C) were observed 60 min after treatment. The largest reductions in average (WBC, 12.1 ± 1.0°C; CWI, 8.4 ± 0.7°C), minimum (WBC, 13.2 ± 1.4°C; CWI, 8.7 ± 0.7°C) and maximum (WBC, 8.8 ± 2.0°C; CWI, 7.2 ± 1.9°C) skin temperature occurred immediately after both CWI and WBC (P<0.05). Skin temperature was significantly lower (P<0.05) immediately after WBC compared to CWI. The present study demonstrates that a single WBC exposure decreases muscle and core temperature to a similar level of those experienced after CWI. Although both treatments significantly reduced skin temperature, WBC elicited a greater decrease compared to CWI. These data may provide information to clinicians and researchers attempting to optimise WBC and CWI protocols in a clinical or sporting setting.",

However, the effect of a single session of whole body cryotherapy (-110°C) on neuromuscular performance has not been well documented. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a single exposure of WBC on elbow flexor neuromuscular performance. Thirteen physically active, healthy young men (age=27.9±4.2 years, mass=79.4±9.7 kg, height=176.7±5.2 cm) were randomly exposed to 2 different experimental conditions separated by a minimum of 72 h: 1) whole body cryotherapy- 3 min at -110°C; 2) control- 3 min at 21°C. All subjects were tested for maximal isokinetic elbow flexion at 60°.s(-1) 30 min before and 10 min after each condition. There were no significant differences in peak torque, average power, total work or muscle activity between conditions. Peak torque was lower at post-test compared to pre-test in both conditions (F=6.58, p=0.025). However, there were no differences between pre-test and post-test for any other variables. These results indicate that strength specialists, athletic trainers and physical therapists might utilize whole body cryotherapy before training or rehabilitation without compromising neuromuscular performance of the elbow flexors.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To (1) search the English-language literature for original research addressing the effect of cryotherapy on joint position sense (JPS) and (2) make recommendations regarding how soon healthy athletes can safely return to participation after cryotherapy. DATA SOURCES: We performed an exhaustive search for original research using the AMED, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and SportDiscus databases from 1973 to 2009 to gather information on cryotherapy and JPS. Key words used were cryotherapy and proprioception, cryotherapy and joint position sense, cryotherapy, and proprioception. STUDY SELECTION: The inclusion criteria were (1) the literature was written in English, (2) participants were human, (3) an outcome measure included JPS, (4) participants were healthy, and (5) participants were tested immediately after a cryotherapy application to a joint. DATA EXTRACTION: The means and SDs of the JPS outcome measures were extracted and used to estimate the effect size (Cohen d) and associated 95% confidence intervals for comparisons of JPS before and after a cryotherapy treatment. The numbers, ages, and sexes of participants in all 7 selected studies were also extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: The JPS was assessed in 3 joints: ankle (n = 2), knee (n = 3), and shoulder (n = 2). The average effect size for the 7 included studies was modest, with effect sizes ranging from -0.08 to 1.17, with a positive number representing an increase in JPS error. The average methodologic score of the included studies was 5.4/10 (range, 5-6) on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. CONCLUSIONS: Limited and equivocal evidence is available to address the effect of cryotherapy on proprioception in the form of JPS. Until further evidence is provided, clinicians should be cautious when returning individuals to tasks requiring components of proprioceptive input immediately after a cryotherapy treatment.",

But although the work of a lot contemporary philosophers touches on this distinction - in the sense that it either has consequences for it, or it assumes results about it - few have really focussed on it recently. This has the consequence that a lot has happened that should affect our view of the analytic/synthetic distinction, while little has been done to work out exactly what the effects are. All these features together make the topic ideal for either a survey or research seminar at the graduate level: it can provide an organising theme which justifies a spectrum of classic readings from Locke to Williamson, passing though Kant, Frege, Carnap, Quine and Kripke on the way, but it could also provide an excuse for a much more narrowly construed research seminar which studies the consequences of really contemporary philosophy of language and linguistics for the distinction. Author Recommends 1. Immanuel Kant, The Critique of Pure Reason [A7-10/B11-14] trans. P. Guyer and A. Wood (Cambridge: (Cambridge University Press, 1999). Kant defined analyticity in three different ways (see the Jashe Logic and Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics for the other two) but here in the First Critique, as he sets up the task of explaining how synthetic a priori judgements are possible, we find the famous definition of analyticity in terms of the predicate-concept belonging to the subject-concept, as well as his account of the modal and epistemic status of analytic judgements in terms of the principle of non-contradiction. 2. Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, trans. J. L. Austin, 2nd ed (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1980), especially sections 3, 87-91. Frege's hedged criticisms of Kant's definition of analyticity and his revision of that definition to appeal to proofs and definitions. 3. Rudolf Carnap, ‘Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology’, reprinted in Meaning and Necessity, 2nd ed (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1958), 205-21. Carnap has much technical work on analyticity, especially in The Logical Syntax of Language and Meaning and Necessity, but in this short paper he presents his philosophical views on the matter in an accessible style. 4. Willard van Orman Quine, ‘Truth by Convention’, reprinted in The Ways of Paradox and Other Essays, (New York, NY: Random House, 1965), 77-106. A long, difficult paper presenting some of Quine's views on definitions as conventions of notational abbreviation and the infamous Regress Argument against the idea that the basic logical symbols are introduced by implicit definition. This is essential reading for anyone serious about engaging with Quine's views on the analytic/synthetic distinction. 5.

Wettstein (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1989), 481-614. A longish monograph which includes a good introduction to direct reference and the contingent analytic. 8. Paul Boghossian, ‘Analyticity Reconsidered?’, Nous, 30.3 (1996): 360-91. In this paper Boghossian distinguishes two different kinds of analyticity - metaphysical and epistemic - and argues that only the metaphysical notion falls to Quine's critique. 9.
