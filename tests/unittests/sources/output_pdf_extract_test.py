On the server side, we notified Apache,', 'Oracle, IBM, Cisco, and various hosting providers. Aka-', 'mai has removed all support for export ciphersuites. Many TLS developers plan to support a new extension that allows', 'clients and servers to negotiate a few well-known groups of 2048-bits and higher and to gracefully reject weak ones [19].', '7. CONCLUSION Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a cornerstone of applied', 'cryptography, but we find that, as used in practice, it is often', 'less secure than widely believed. The problems stem from', 'the fact that the number field sieve for discrete log allows an', 'attacker to perform a single precomputation that depends', 'only on the group, after which computing individual logs in', 'that group has a far lower cost. Although this fact is well', "known to cryptographers, it apparently has not been widely understood by system builders. Likewise, many cryptogra- phers did not appreciate that the security of a large fraction of Internet communication depends on Diffie-Hellman key exchanges that use a few small, widely shared groups. A key lesson from this state of affairs is that cryptogra- phers and creators of practical systems need to work together more effectively. System builders should take responsibility for being aware of applicable cryptanalytic attacks. Cryp- tographers, for their part, should involve themselves in how crypto is actually being applied, such as through engagement with standards efforts and software review. Bridging the per- ilous gap that separates these communities will be essential for keeping future systems secure.
